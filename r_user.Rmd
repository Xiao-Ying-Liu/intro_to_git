## Course and Course Website Recommendation

For those of you using R, there is an excellent course (NTRES 6100) at Cornell instructed by Nina, providing hands-on instruction on how to collaborate with others using R.

You can check out her course website [here](https://nt246.github.io/NTRES-6100-data-science/index.html). This website presents you steps to use GitHub in R, from A to Z.
