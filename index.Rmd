## Intro to Git

This is a brief intro summarizing my experience using GitHub/Git. You can find configuration information and some very basic commands here. For more information, Google and Stack Overflow will always be your best friend.

Reminder: do not put your Git repo under **Box or Dropbox** folder in case of synchronization issue.
